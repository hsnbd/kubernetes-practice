# Production-Ready Microservices E-commerce App

## Architecture:
- Frontend (React/Angular via NGINX)
- API Gateway (NGINX/Express)
- Product Service (Node.js/Go)
- Order Service (Python)
- User Service (Node.js + MongoDB)
- Databases (MongoDB/PostgreSQL)

## Phase Breakdown:
- Core Infrastructure: Set up cluster, namespaces, RBAC, and resource quotas
- Deploy Microservices: Deploy frontend, backend services, and databases with ConfigMaps, Secrets, and probes
- Networking: Use Ingress controller with TLS, define routing and service discovery
- Observability: Install Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, and metrics-server for monitoring
- Autoscaling & Resilience: Configure HPA, PodDisruptionBudgets, affinity rules, and test failure recovery
- GitOps & CI/CD: Containerize apps, use Helm/Kustomize, automate deployment with GitHub Actions and ArgoCD/Flux
